= acts_as_filterable

Small BS plugin that allows you to add small processing filters to 
ActiveRecord attributes. This was born from working with a legacy 
database that had a bunch of bad apps depending on the fields 
looking just the right way.

Instead of implementing :before_validate all over the place, I threw this together
so that I can just apply macros.
